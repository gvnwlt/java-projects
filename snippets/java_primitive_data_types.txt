# primitives 
  
  The foundation for all other types in java 

  Integer, Floats, Character, Boolean

  The only real difference in types is the size of storage they take up. 

# integer type sizes in bits (effects the ranges of values that can be stored in a type)
  -byte: 8
  -short: 16
  -int: 32
  -long: 64

# float type size in bits 
  -float: 32
  -double: 64
