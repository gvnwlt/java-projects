# java packages 

  Provides organization in a java program. 

  Effects source code file structure. 

  Package names are all lowercase. 

  Creates a sense of uniqueness. 

  Use reverse domain name (com.name.package)

  Adding the package key term in a class file makes that file appart of the package:

  package com.something; 

  public class Main {
      public static void main (Strings[] args) {

      }
  }

  is -> com.something.Main (each part of the packages name need to be apart of a subfolder)

# folder structure for a package
  src 
    com
      something
         Main.java
